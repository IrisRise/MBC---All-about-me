<h1><span style="color:darkviolet">How I Coordinate</span></h1>

<h2><span style="color:darkgreen">
Hi there! I am your State Coordinator for Florida Manabadi Centers</span></h2>

Lets break ice over a few words I say here, then followed by our 1-1 phone/personal chat that I will soon be scheduling with you.

<h3>WHO (Am I)</h3>

I know we have been introduced but I am Sirisha Modukuru Akella; I myself have my own Manabadi Chapter at West Palm Beach. I am also its coordinator. I started in 2016 September. It has been a very satisfying and fulfiiling experience to work with children every weekend and watching them learn and grow. I am a mom myself and my daughter too goes to my center.<br>You may wonder about my **Leadership Experience** to be able to coordinate and guide an entire state. All the below were/are volunteer roles and I had/have no authority over any team member reporting/working for/with me. I employed the tenets and principles of Servant Leadership to deal with these roles. I aspire to motivate, inspire and lead others by example ... I am only here to help others to find their interest and support their growth.

So here is my **Leadership Experience**:

|Leadership Role|Organization|Duration|Role Description|
|----------------|---------------|------------|------------|
|Cultural Secretary|Telugu Association of South Florida (TASF)| 2013-2017|Event management and coordination along with PR management, member management.|
|Area Director|Toastmasters International|2014-2015|Mentor, Coach, provide leadership and guidance to all toastmaster clubs in a designated area while assisting them and motivating them to achieve their yearly goals set by Toastmasters International|

|Manabadi Florida State Coordinator|Manabadi Siliconandhra|2016 - COntinuing|Provide leadership, mentoring, coaching and guidance to all Florida Manabadi centers to any parent teacher or student that needs it. <br>Being a Manabadi liason for these centers and making sure that all centers are Manabadi compliant and have all the resources that they need to function properly.|

Here is my **Teaching Experience**. None of these were/are earning roles. I did them all as a volunteer out of sheer pleasure of having an opportunity to share my knowledge. So I had/have no authority over these students. All I could do was/is motivate them and grab their attention when I sensed their interest. Once again, I employed principles and tenets of Servant Leadership.

<h3>WHAT (Do I do)</h3>
As far as Manabadi coordinatorship goes,  I do everything a volunteer in leadership role should do. But I follow the tenets of Servant Leadership. As your coordinator, I basically see myself as your service-provider rather than someone who dictates terms to you. I will explain what Manabadi is all about, its mission and vision and where you fit in as a coordinator or a teacher or a parent or a volunteer and what is expected of you... then I will let you do your duty all the while making sure that you and rest of our team is being Manabadi compliant and brand loyal. And then I will leave the rest to you to carry out your duties with as much zest, creativity and innovation you can bring in to your role. So point-wise I:
<br />
    <ol> 
        <li>Am a Service-Provider to all Florida Manabadi centers and its members (Coordinators, Teachers, Parents, Students and other volunteers).  </li>
        <li>Will get you acquainted with Manabadi -its policies, mission, vision, etc.</li>
        <li>Will explain your role, duties, expectations and goals</li>
        <li>Will act as your representative to Manabadi Development Team and other leadership groups</li>
        <li>Will be Manabadi's leadership's liason to you</li>
        <li>Will be your guide, mentor, coach, facilitator and conflict resolver</li>
        <li>Will be accountable for every center's success and progress that I am responsible for.</li>
   </ol>

   <h3>WHEN (am I available to you)</h3>

   <h4>My door is always open for you... but my schedule is NOT!!!</h4>
   However I'll say you can contact me 24/7 as long as you text me. You should have my email and my phone number with you. Please text me on our common Whatsapp group (I must have added you already, else contact me asap) or Manabadi's Slack group. I will get back to you as soon as I can. If I am busy in my office work or in a class, I won't be able to answer my phone. I only answer phones in these cases for emergencies... So if it is an emergency for you, just text the word and I will rush to your aid! I promise!
   <br>
   I also make a rotuine visit to various Florida locations. When I come to your center, my entire time there is yours. If you have certain MB projects or ideas or tasks that you want to discuss or need me to forward it to the development team, that is a good time to do it. I would love to see your center at work and meet your set of teachers/parents and students!

   <h3>WHY (am I here)</h3>

   Children are great people! They not only learn from us but teach us to be simple and straightforward. I learnt a lot from my set of kids over the years. I have learnt what it means to be gentle, truthful, firm, bit most of all being yourself. I also learnt that to preserve one's identity, one needs a healthy self-image, self-confidence, self-reliance and integrity. My greatest mission in life is to boost these in our children. They all are such amazing people, I feel we need to do all to make them grow, branch, flower and fruit as themselves and not what others expect them to be. For them to withstand the tempest of peer pressure and torment of social expectations, it is important to teach them self-awareness. They need to realize who they are... I hope you all will join me in nurturing our children and thereby nutruing ourselves.
